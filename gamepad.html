					<h1><a href="https://github.com/lcaraballoj/Arduino-Gamepad" target="_blank">Arduino Gamepad</a></h1>
					<p>
						The Arduino Gamepad was created to teach gaming design and development students about soldering and electronics. What started off as a very involved and complicated
                        process with little success turned into one of the most workshops with a high success rate.

                                                This is an image of the first prototype of the gamepad. It used a stripboard, but the buttons were much lower than the joystick
                                                and we had to cut each wire and strip the wires to an appropriate length.

											<h2>Prototype 2</h2>
												<p><font color="black">
													Here we were able to improve on the position of the buttons. But doing so required the use of two strip boards and more wires. This was the product used for the first workshop.
                                                    To prepare we had to custom cut and strip every wire for about 10 students and had to custom cut and strip the stripboards. The success rate was low since short circuiting the wires
                                                    when soldering was very easy to do based on the layout. Overall this workshop did run smoothly.

										Determined to improve on both the Arduino Gamepad itself and the workshop I began experimenting with <a href="https://github.com/lcaraballoj/Eagle-PCBs">custom PCBs</a>. After creating various tests
                                        and running workshops with these PCBs, I felt confident in tackling the gamepad again. We created two PCBs, one for the Arduino and joystick and one for the buttons. We used extending header pins
                                        to attach the two PCBs. Overall this workshop ran extremely well and every student who came was able to successfully make their own Arduino Gamepad. The one snag was the wiring between the button of 
                                        joystick button was incomplete, but once that was fixed we had a complete Arduino gamepad workshop that could be continuously run.

                                        We needed to use a Pro Micro Arduino in order to use the buttons as keyboard keys, w, a, s, d, and to use the joystick as a mouse with the press of the joystick simulating a right click.
                                        We also needed two different libraries <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/keyboard/">keyboard</a> and <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/mouse/">mouse</a>. 
                                        Because we were using a custom PCB all the joystick values and button values for the Arduino were the same. This resulted in universal code that could be shared and flashed on the gamepads after assembly.
