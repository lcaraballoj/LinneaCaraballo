											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Currently I am a graduate student at Wesleyan University studying mathematics who has been lucky to work
											in many different sectors, from non-profit organizations to start-ups.
											Previously I attended Sacred Heart University where I earned a Bachelor of Science in
											Computer Science and Mathematics and worked in the school's makerspace, the IDEA lab, as an
											electronics specialist.

											efficient and effective experience for both client and internal use. My experience was focused on the RWC and Slack channels, but also had 
											the opportunity to explore SMS and IVR to create internal solutions for the company and a bot that can aid students with disabilities navigate

										<p>Oversee the electronics section of the IDEA Lab, Sacred Heart University's makerspace. This includes making sure that all equipment 
											is operational and that all supplies and consumables are available as well as ensure that all safety procedures and rules of the space 
											and general lab are being followed. The Electronics Specialist is also responsible for creating workshops and trainings to engage with 
											the greater community. Trainings and workshops range from soldering, Arduino, PCB creating, Scratch, programming, Linux, and Git.

										<h2><strong>Engineering Intern</strong></h2>
										<h3><a href="https://owlcyberdefense.com/" target="_blank">Owl Cyber Defense</a></h3>
										<p>Create important demonstration models that can be used in order to show off the cybersecurity capabilities of Owl’s data diodes. This 
											includes simulating attacks that the diodes can block as well as successfully sending packets of data. These demos utilized two Raspberry 
											Pis sending UDP packets of sensor data to each other with the XDE Radium in the middle to filter out the packets. Along with this demo came 
											close analysis of the documentation of the XDE Radium and the creation of documentation for the demos in order to provide better insight and 
											support of the usability of the XDE Radium. The use of MQTT packages was also explored on a clients order to receive MQTT packages and have them 
											automatically converted to a CSV file in order to store its data in a FTP server.

										<h2><strong>IT Intern</strong></h2>
										<h3><a href="https://www.americares.org/" target="_blank">Americares</a></h3>
										<p>Worked closely with a small team in order to conduct the IT audit and come up with a way to automate the process through the use of Alteryx workflows 
											and careful documentation of the process. This audit also included cleaning the Active Directory and ensuring that future employees running the audit 
											have a good grasp on the Alteryx workflow. Alteryx was also utilized in the creation of a database to help keep track of medical supplies being 
											distributed to sub-recipients. This Alteryx workflow was created to take in Excel templates into database tables in Microsoft SQL Management Studio.

										<strong><a href="https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1798&context=acadfest">Quaternion Rotation: A Magical Journey to the Fourth Dimension</a></strong>
										<p>Quaternions are an extension of the complex number system and have
											a large presence in various applied fields. The most common use of quater-
											nions is to model the rotation of three-dimensional objects. In this paper
											we will explore what quaternions are, discuss some quaternion history and
											establish the fundamental concepts of quaternion algebra. This will lead
											us into a discussion of quaternion rotation, how it works, and why it is the
											preferred method for rotation by highlighting some common issues with
											other forms of rotation. We will then analyze original data depicting the
											speed at which quaternions can be calculated versus other forms of rotation.
											So let us go on a magical journey to the fourth dimension as we explore
											quaternions.
