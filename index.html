											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Hello! I am an endlessly curious graduate student with a strong passion for mathematics. I am constantly seeking to explore the intersection between mathematics and computer science. 
											My academic journey has been dedicated to exploring the multifaceted applications of mathematics within the realm of computer science. Currently, my research is centered around investigating 
											the relationship between graph theory and database theory. My ultimate goal is to use my programming skills and Mathematical education to derive actionable insights from data analysis. <br><br>
											Outside of mathematics I enjoy going for runs and have a strong passion for fountain pens and bears.

										<h2 class="jobtitle"><strong>Junior Solutions Design Intern</strong></h2>
										<h3><a href="https://onereach.ai/" target="_blank">OneReach.ai</a></h3>
										<p>
											Trained and built custom conversational AI solutions using <a href="https://onereach.ai/communication_studio_g2/" target="_blank">Communication Studio G2</a> while working alongside a team of 
											designers to deliver an efficient and effective experience for both client and internal use. My experience was focused on the RWC and Slack channels, but I also had

										<h3><a href="https://www.sacredheart.edu/academics/colleges--schools/school-of-computer-science--engineering/facilities/idea-lab/" target="_blank">Sacred Heart University</a></h3>
										<p> 
											Managed the electronics section of the IDEA Lab, Sacred Heart University's makerspace. This includes making sure that all equipment was
											operational and that all supplies and consumables were available as well as ensuring that all safety procedures and rules of the space 
											and general lab were being followed. As the Electronics Specialist I was also responsible for creating workshops and trainings to engage with 
											the greater community. Trainings and workshops ranged from soldering, Arduino, PCB creating, Scratch, programming, Linux, and Git.

										<h2><strong>Engineering Intern</strong></h2>
										<h3><a href="https://owlcyberdefense.com/" target="_blank">Owl Cyber Defense</a></h3>
										<p> 
											Created important demonstration models to show off the cybersecurity capabilities of Owlâ€™s data diodes. This 
											included simulating attacks that the diodes could block as well as successfully sending packets of data. These demos utilized two Raspberry 
											Pis sending UDP packets of sensor data to each other with the XDE Radium in the middle to filter out the packets. Along with this demo came 
											close analysis of the documentation of the XDE Radium and the creation of documentation for the demos in order to provide better insight and 
											support of the usability of the XDE Radium.

										<h2><strong>IT Intern</strong></h2>
										<h3><a href="https://www.americares.org/" target="_blank">Americares</a></h3>
										<p> 
											Worked closely with a small team in order to conduct the IT audit and come up with a way to automate the process through the use of Alteryx workflows 
											and careful documentation of the process. This audit also included cleaning the Active Directory and ensuring that future employees running the audit 
											have a good grasp on the Alteryx workflow. Alteryx was also utilized in the creation of a database to help keep track of medical supplies being 
											distributed to sub-recipients. This Alteryx workflow was created to take in Excel templates into database tables in Microsoft SQL Management Studio.

										<strong><a href="https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1798&context=acadfest" target="_blank">Quaternion Rotation: A Magical Journey to the Fourth Dimension</a></strong>
										<p>Quaternions are an extension of the complex number system and have
											a large presence in various applied fields. The most common use of quaternions 
											is to model the rotation of three-dimensional objects. In this paper
											we will explore what quaternions are, discuss some quaternion history and
											establish the fundamental concepts of quaternion algebra. This will lead
											us into a discussion of quaternion rotation, how it works, and why it is the
											preferred method for rotation by highlighting some common issues with
											other forms of rotation. We will then analyze original data depicting the
											speed at which quaternions can be calculated versus other forms of rotation.
											So let us go on a magical journey to the fourth dimension as we explore
											quaternions.
